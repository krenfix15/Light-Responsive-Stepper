# light-responsive-stepper
This is my thesis for finishing the CS degree and is represented by an embedded system to control rotation according to light intensity using the STM32F429I-DISC1 microcontroller.

# What I Learned

* How a microcontroller works
* How to use the peripherals of a microcontroller
* How to work with TouchGFX, CubeMX, CubeIDE

A demonstration video can be found in the repository.
